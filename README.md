Analyzing sentiment and key phrases in social media posts

Using posts obtained from Facebook Graph API, we will try to run each post into the openAI API to evaluate the post and to see if the openAI models do a good job of detecting sentiment and key phrases. 

The posts will be mixed with some in English and Spanish. However, majority should be in Spanish since the page providing the post is targeted at Spanish speaking users
